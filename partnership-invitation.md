# Looking for a Marketing & Admin Co-Founder — Full Ecosystem to Launch and Manage your Start-up/SaaS
(Media Generations, HD Video Editor, "SEO Everywhere" Agent, Custom Content-Generation, and more)

I've spent the last 6-7 months developign  **Creators Multiverse** — a production-ready platform that helps startups and Marketers launch their brand presence.


## The Problem

>70% of buying decisions now happen outside Google — on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, ChatGPT, Amazon, a random insta comment, etc. 
Founders and small teams don't have the bandwidth to be everywhere at once.
Or the Time. Or the Knowledge. Or the Inspiration. 

## The Product (live & functional)

- **Multi-platform content generator** — brand-consistent posts optimized per platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook), with AI image and text generation in multi-languages
- **Media Studio** — AI image & video generation using frontier models (Imagen 4.0, Veo 3.1, Sora 2, GPT-Image, Gemini 3), plus an integrated video editor with timeline, captions, transitions, and audio
- **SEO Everywhere Agent** — visibility analysis and content strategy across Google, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, ChatGPT, and Amazon. Competitor mapping, blog generation, engagement opportunity discovery
- **Brand management** — company profiles with tone, colors, mission carried through all generated content
- **HD Video Editor** - Intuitive & simple HD Video editor allowing free HD Export and more (up to the natural limitations of web-based architecture of a video editor pipeline), saving a necessary subscription to an Editor

## Business Model

Credit-based, no subscriptions. Credits never expire. Free tier (10 credits/day) for exploration.

## Tech Stack & Maturity

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Supabase (auth, database, edge functions, part of the back-end), Stripe payments, - Serverless edge functions, async video generation with crash recovery
- Private agentic backend with custom LLM orchestration pipelines for context, image processing, video editing and processing and more - hosted in Google Cloud Run (Python)
- The platform is **built and working**


## What I'm Looking For

A **Marketing & Admin partner** — someone who understands go-to-market, community building, startup growth, and operational execution. 
Someone who sees the potential in a tool built for the exact problem creators and founders face today.
And of course, someone with some minimal possibility to invest 50/50 in Ads & Costs (or in whatever equity we agree upon)

If there's a match, I'm open to discussing different partnership structures — equity split, revenue share, or other arrangements that make sense for both sides.



**DM me** if this resonates.
