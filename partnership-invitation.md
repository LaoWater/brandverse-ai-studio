# Looking for a Marketing & Admin Co-Founder — AI-Powered Content Platform, Production-Ready

I'm Raul (Neo), a full-stack engineer based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. I've built **BrandVerse AI Studio** — a production-ready platform that helps startups launch their brand presence across every platform that matters (not just Google).

## The Problem

73% of buying decisions now happen outside Google — on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, ChatGPT, Amazon. Founders and small teams don't have the bandwidth to be everywhere at once.

## The Product (live & functional)

- **Multi-platform content generator** — brand-consistent posts optimized per platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook), with AI image and text generation in 10+ languages
- **Media Studio** — AI image & video generation using frontier models (Imagen 4.0, Veo 3.1, Sora 2, GPT-Image, Gemini 3), plus an integrated video editor with timeline, captions, transitions, and audio
- **SEO Everywhere Agent** — visibility analysis and content strategy across Google, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, ChatGPT, and Amazon. Competitor mapping, blog generation, engagement opportunity discovery
- **Brand management** — company profiles with tone, colors, mission carried through all generated content

## Business Model

Credit-based, no subscriptions. Credits never expire. Free tier (10 credits/day) for exploration, then packs from $3 (100 credits) to $50 (3,000 credits). Pricing is aligned with startup cash flow — pay when you need, use when you're ready.

## Tech Stack & Maturity

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (auth, database, edge functions), Stripe payments
- Private agentic backend with custom LLM orchestration pipelines (Gemini, OpenAI, Vertex AI)
- Google App Engine hosting
- 14 serverless edge functions, 16 database migrations, async video generation with crash recovery
- The platform is **built and working** — not a prototype, not a pitch deck

## What I Bring

The entire technical foundation — frontend, backend, agentic AI pipelines, infrastructure, payments, deployment. I'm the founding technical partner and I'm looking for someone to give this product life on the business side.

## What I'm Looking For

A **Marketing & Admin partner** — someone who understands go-to-market, community building, startup growth, and operational execution. Someone who sees the potential in a tool built for the exact problem creators and founders face today.

If there's a match, I'm open to discussing different partnership structures — equity split, revenue share, or other arrangements that make sense for both sides.

**DM me** if this resonates. Happy to do a live demo or walkthrough.
