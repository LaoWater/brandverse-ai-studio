In SEO and beyond (and part of the main thematic landing page) - we will talk about how actual conversions are evolving, and as you can find by studying for and on yourself, decisions no longer are happening in SEO, but rather scattered across many platforms and environments - all connected.
Based new SEO on this:“Neil Patel presents a paradigm shift in digital marketing, emphasizing that consumers no longer engage in traditional search behavior but instead make rapid decisions across multiple non-Google platforms. The conventional SEO focus on Google rankings, backlinks, and meta descriptions is now insufficient because 73% of searches and decision-making happen outside Google on platforms like TikTok, Reddit, Amazon, YouTube, ChatGPT, Instagram, and others. These platforms serve distinct psychological and functional roles in consumer decision processes, requiring marketers to rethink their strategies.
Key Insights
* 		Consumers are deciding, not searching in the traditional keyword-and-links sense. Decisions happen in micro-moments across diverse platforms.
* 		Google still handles 27% of searches, but most buying decisions occur elsewhere.
* 		The “Google trap” is optimizing solely for Google visibility while customers make decisions on other platforms, leading to decent traffic but poor conversion and sales.
* 		The consumer journey is no longer linear but a constellation of micro-decisions happening simultaneously or rapidly across platforms.
* 		Each platform functions as a unique decision engine with its own behavioral drivers:
    * 		TikTok: Emotional, visual, novelty-driven decisions.
    * 		YouTube: In-depth, authoritative content for evaluation.
    * 		ChatGPT and AI models: Demand factual, clearly cited information.
    * 		Amazon: Social proof via reviews and trust signals.
    * 		Instagram: Aspirational identity and lifestyle buying.
    * 		Reddit: Raw authenticity and unfiltered opinions.
* 		Search Everywhere Optimization (SEO expanded): Instead of focusing on Google alone, businesses must optimize their presence across all platforms where decisions occur.
* 		Visibility (being seen) is different from validation (being trusted and mentioned). Validation drives AI recommendations and real consumer choices.
* 		AI models summarize based on trust signals and mentions, so  requires tailored content and engagement strategies aligned with its unique decision-making code.
